Welcome! I’m **Carlos Reyes**—software engineer, performance sleuth, and lifelong aviation geek.
This site is where I distill four decades of hands-on programming into clear, reproducible advice on writing *fast, correct, and maintainable* code.

## Who I Am

* **C++ specialist since 1987** (first exposed at Bell Labs) with roots that go back to 6502 assembly games I shipped while still in high school.
* **Performance engineer & consultant.** I founded **Giopler**, a profiling/debugging SaaS that blends PMU counters with real-time visualisation. Past gigs range from HPC image-processing on AVX-512 to vector-engine ML accelerators.
* **Versatile polyglot.** Comfortably fluent in Python, TypeScript, Scala, and half a dozen other languages, but I always return to modern C++ for its mix of control and expressiveness.
* **Published author & educator.** Two tech books, 350+ performance-focused blog posts, 150 educational videos, and 50 podcasts—plus talks at conferences and meet-ups.
* **Aviation & RC-model enthusiast.** When I’m not squeezing cycles out of cache lines, you’ll find me flying sailplanes—both full-scale and radio controlled—or hacking on flight-sim add-ons.

## What You’ll Find Here

| Content type | Typical depth | Why it matters |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Latency tear-downs** | Flame graphs, counter traces, before/after patch sets | Immediate, copy-pasteable speed gains |
| **Modern C++ tutorials** | Concepts, ranges, executors, **no undefined behaviour** | Safer code that still screams |
| **Tooling guides** | perf, VTune, BPF, sanitizers, clang-Tidy pipelines | Reproduce my workflow on any Linux box |
| **Architecture essays** | Cache-aware data structures (e.g., HAMT), lock-free patterns | Big-O meets branch predictors |
| **Flight-sim tech posts** | Physics models, WASM in MSFS, UAV control loops | Where code performance meets real-world aerodynamics |

Everything here is open for you to read, fork, and benchmark. Text and images are licensed **CC BY 4.0**; code samples are **Apache-2.0**—see the *Legal Notices* page for details.

## My Philosophy

> *“Code is a liability until it proves its worth on the profiler.”*

I write for developers who want numbers, not platitudes—people who believe that clarity, correctness, and computational efficiency are three sides of the same triangle.

### Stay in Touch – I’d love to hear from you

**Drop me a note—seriously.**
Whether you just skimmed a paragraph or spent the weekend rewriting a hot path, your feedback drives this site forward.

#### Why you might reach out

* **The article saved you time or CPU cycles.** Success stories keep me writing and help justify deeper dives.
* **You’re stuck on a gnarly performance bug.** Quick clarifications are free; full audits and mentoring sessions are available if you need heavyweight help.
* **You have an idea, dataset, or war-story that would make a great post.** Reader challenges often turn into the most popular articles; you’ll get full credit and a backlink.
* **You spotted an error or edge case I missed.** Fixes ship fast, and contributors are acknowledged.
* **You just want to geek out about gliders, flight-sim physics, or obscure CPU micro-ops.** Same energy here.
