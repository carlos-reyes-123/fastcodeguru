## The folklore

> Branching is slow, so replace `&&` with `&` (or `||` with `|`) and the optimizer will thank you.

That advice shows up in code reviews, on Reddit threads, and even in seasoned code bases. The intuition is simple:

* `&&` *may* short-circuit, so the compiler must generate a conditional branch.
* `&` always evaluates both operands, so the resulting instruction stream can be branch-free.

Therefore, the bitwise form “must” be faster—right?

We are going to stress-test that claim from **four angles**:

1. Language rules (what the Standard *guarantees*).
2. What compilers actually emit in 2025.
3. Micro-architecture (branch prediction, cache, ILP).
4. Human factors—maintainability, bugs, and intent.

The result is a nuanced picture: sometimes `&` wins, often it makes no difference, and in many real programs it is a **liability**.

---

## Ground truth: what the Standard says[^std]

[^std]: *C++ Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2023) §7.6.14/§7.6.15* – sequencing rules for logical operators.

* Built-in `&&` **must** evaluate left → right and must **not** evaluate the right operand when the left is `false` (or when the result is already known for `||`). This is sequenced, not negotiable.[^stackoverflow]
* Overloaded `operator&&/||` are just function calls—*no* short-circuiting.
* Bitwise `&`/`|` always evaluate both operands and produce an integral value.

[^stackoverflow]: [compilation - C++ compiler optimizations and short-circuit evaluation - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31052979/c-compiler-optimizations-and-short-circuit-evaluation)

> **Key takeaway:** Behavioural semantics are fixed. The optimizer can *re-arrange* side-effect-free instructions, but it may not “speculatively” evaluate an operand if doing so would create an **observable** difference in the abstract machine.

Cppreference summarises the rule crisply: “Built-in `&&` and `||` perform short-circuit evaluation; bitwise logic operators do not.”[^cppref]

## “But my disassembler shows identical code!”

That is not a myth. For side-effect-free operands the optimiser is allowed to collapse:

```cpp
bool fast = (x & y);      // bitwise
bool safe = (x && y);     // logical
```

into the same branch-free sequence because it can prove that:

* `x` and `y` are scalars already materialised in registers,
* reading them twice is free,
* the observable result (`fast`/`safe`) is identical.

A nice real-world benchmark shows exactly that: Clang 15 with `-O3` produced *nearly* identical inner loops for `&` and `&&` scans over a 160 M-element array.[^wordsandbuttons]

**What happened to short-circuiting?**
It is still honoured *semantically*, but the optimiser recognised that evaluating the second operand eagerly **does not change program behaviour**, so it emitted branch-free code that happens to read both variables. The standard’s “as-if” rule is satisfied.

## The hidden foot-guns of `if (a & b)`

| Category | Risk when replacing `&&` with `&` |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Side effects** | `b++` now always increments, even when `a` is `false`. |
| **Operator precedence** | `&` binds weaker than `==`, stronger than `&&`; many subtle bugs stem from forgotten parentheses. |
| **Integral promotion** | `&` works on *numbers*. If `a`/`b` are `bool`, the result is still `int`, not `bool`. A subsequent comparison with `true` becomes tautological. |
| **Overloaded operators** | Custom `operator&` might exist and change semantics silently. |
| **Readability / intent** | Future maintainers will assume “bit mask” semantics, not “logical test”. |

---

## Performance anatomy

1. **Branch prediction:** Modern CPUs predict the `jne` generated by `&&` with >95 % accuracy for stable data patterns. Misprediction costs ~14 cycles, but only when the data is adversarial.

2. **Instruction-level parallelism:** Eager evaluation can sometimes *reduce* ILP because both operands must be ready before the fused compare can retire.

3. **Cache traffic:** If `b` is a pointer dereference, forcing the read every time may hurt cache residency. Short-circuiting can be a win.

4. **Speculative loads:** An out-of-order core may fetch `b` early anyway; if it turns out the load was unnecessary the cost is often hidden.

5. **GPU / SIMD kernels:** Here branch divergence is lethal; replacing `&&` with `&` (or `*`) makes sense—but you should express it explicitly in a data-parallel style (e.g. `select(mask, …)`), not with C++ control flow.

## Measuring instead of guessing

Below is a minimal benchmark you can paste into **Compiler Explorer** or run with `perf stat`—modify the `MODE` macro to flip operators.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <random>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

#ifndef MODE               // 0 = bitwise &, 1 = logical &&
#define MODE 1
#endif

int main() {
    constexpr size_t N = 128 * 1024 * 1024;
    std::vector<uint8_t> a(N), b(N);
    std::mt19937 rng(0);
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(0, 255);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        a[i] = dist(rng);
        b[i] = dist(rng);
    }

    size_t hits = 0;
    auto t0 = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
    for (size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
#if MODE
        if ((a[i] > 200) && (b[i] > 200))  // logical
#else
        if ((a[i] > 200) &  (b[i] > 200))  // bitwise
#endif
            ++hits;
    }
    auto t1 = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
    std::cout << "hits=" << hits << "  "
              << std::chrono::duration<double>(t1 - t0).count()
              << " s\n";
}
```

On an Ice Lake i7 at `-O3` the difference is typically **< 1 %**, completely drowned by measurement noise unless you pin the benchmark and flush caches between runs.

---

## When *does* bitwise pay off?

* Inside tight, branch-averse GPU shaders or SIMD loops, where every warp must execute the same instruction stream.
* When computing a compound predicate that you will reuse later:

  ```cpp
  uint32_t m = flags & READY & ENABLED & !ERROR;
  if (m) …
  ```

* For bit-mask idioms (`if (flags & FLAG_WRITE)`)—but that is not a boolean *logic* replacement; the intent is genuinely “test bit k”.

Even in those cases document your intent with a comment; the form is unusual enough that reviewers will ask.

---

## Debunking common myths

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| “Compilers can ignore the short-circuit rule if `b` has no side effects.” | They can *re-order* or *speculate* as long as the abstract machine observes the same effects. Sequenced side effects (I/O, volatile access, `atomic<>`) still forbid premature evaluation. |
| “`&` is branch-free, therefore faster.” | Only if the branch is unpredictable *and* the second operand is in cache. Otherwise `&&` is at worst equal, sometimes better. |
| “Logical operators expand to bigger machine code.” | Modern optimisers fold simple boolean logic into flag registers; the size difference is mostly the conditional jump. |
| “Using `&` avoids the register dependency chain.” | Not necessarily—both forms need both values before retirement unless the compiler transforms the predicate into a single compare-and-branch. |

---

## Concurrency and atomics

For `std::atomic<bool>` the *value* read is a side effect visible to other threads (§6.9.2.1 ¶7). A conforming compiler **must not** merge or speculate away the short-circuit. Rely on `&&` to avoid spurious loads/stores across threads; replacing it with `&` can lengthen the critical section or even change lock-free algorithms.

---

## Style, intent, and code-review heuristics

1. **Default to `&&`/`||`** unless you have a *measured* reason.
2. **Document** any deliberate use of `&` on booleans (`// branch-free predicate for GPU`).
3. **Isolate tricks** behind helper functions or constexpr lambdas so the intent is explicit.
4. **Write tests** that capture side-effect expectations. A refactor that changes `++b` to `b` can silently break logic when `&` is used.

---

## A quick guideline table

| Situation | Recommended operator |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Plain boolean predicate in CPU code | `&& / \|\|` |
| Bit-mask test (`flags & FLAG`) | `& / \|` |
| GPU kernel, shader, or wide SIMD | `& / \|` (with a comment) |
| Mixed types or potential side effects | Stick to `&& / \|\|` |
| Overloaded user-defined types | Prefer functions (`all_of`, `any_of`) |

---

## Conclusion

The **performance delta** between `&&` and `&` has mostly evaporated on today’s optimising compilers and superscalar CPUs. What remains is a **semantic delta** that can—and regularly does—bite maintainers.

Unless you have a profiler trace, an ISA you know intimately, and operands guaranteed side-effect-free, treat `if (a & b)` for what it is: a **micro-optimisation gamble** that trades clarity and correctness for at best marginal speed gains.

Opt for the code that **communicates intent** first. Let the optimiser prove you wrong later.

---

**TL;DR** – Use `&&` unless you can prove that `&` is faster *and* harmless. The compiler usually does the proving for you.
