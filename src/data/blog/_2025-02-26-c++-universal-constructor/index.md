## Introduction

I‚Äôve been fascinated recently by the idea of combining default-, copy-, and move-construction all in one ‚Äúuniversal constructor.‚Äù In this article I‚Äôll walk you through:

* **What** a universal constructor is
* **How** to implement one in C++23
* **Why** you might (or might not) want to use it
* **Caveats**, portability concerns, and real-world anecdotes

Throughout, I‚Äôll sprinkle in code samples, tables, callouts, and examples drawn partly from my own code and partly from stories I‚Äôve picked up in game-dev, finance, and systems-programming circles.

## Why even think about a universal constructor?

In most C++ classes you end up writing three constructors (or relying on the compiler to generate them):

1. **Default constructor**
2. **Copy constructor**
3. **Move constructor**

Occasionally you‚Äôll write them yourself to enforce invariants, add logging, or control exception-safety. But maintaining three overloads can feel boilerplate-y, especially when they mostly share the same logic.

> **üí° Fun fact:** On one project I worked on, our class `EntityState` grew to five constructors (default, copy, move, copy-from-JSON, move-from-JSON), and we spent more time writing tests to exercise each overload than actually implementing features!

A ‚Äúuniversal constructor‚Äù aims to fold all three into one templated overload:

```cpp
template<typename U = T>
requires std::same_as<std::remove_cvref_t<U>, T>
explicit T(U&& other = {}) noexcept( /* ‚Ä¶ */ );
```

This single template handles:

* **No-argument calls** ‚Üí default initialization
* **Lvalue arguments** ‚Üí copy semantics
* **Rvalue arguments** ‚Üí move semantics

The payoff? Less duplication. The trade-off? More template complexity, subtler overload resolution, and potential interactions with other special members.

---

## A step-by-step implementation

Let‚Äôs build a minimal class `Universal` that packs default, copy, and move into one constructor. I‚Äôll show the full code, then dig into each piece.

```cpp
#include <concepts>      // for std::same_as
#include <type_traits>   // for type traits
#include <utility>       // for std::move

struct Universal {
    int data_{42};

    // 1. Default constructor
    Universal() noexcept {
        // maybe some complex setup
    }

    // 2. The universal constructor
    template<typename U = Universal>
    requires std::same_as<std::remove_cvref_t<U>, Universal>
    explicit Universal(
        U&& other = {}                      // default, lvalue, or rvalue
    ) noexcept(
        // move-case noexcept?
        (std::is_rvalue_reference_v<U&&> &&
         std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<Universal>)
        ||
        // copy-case noexcept?
        (!std::is_rvalue_reference_v<U&&> &&
         std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<Universal>)
    )
    : Universal{}  // delegate to default ctor
    {
        if constexpr (std::is_rvalue_reference_v<U&&>) {
            // Move semantics
            data_ = std::move(other.data_);
        } else {
            // Copy semantics
            data_ = other.data_;
        }
    }
};
```

> **Tip:** Delegating to `Universal{}` in the member-initializer list ensures any complex default setup runs exactly once.

### Breaking down the pieces

1. **`template<typename U = Universal>`**

   * A defaulted template parameter allows us to call `Universal{}` (no args) and deduce `U = Universal`.
2. **`U&& other = {}`**

   * Accepts an lvalue reference (`Universal&`), rvalue reference (`Universal&&`), or default-constructed prvalue (`{}`).
3. **`requires std::same_as<std::remove_cvref_t<U>, Universal>`**

   * Constrains the overload so that only `Universal` (ignoring cv-qualifiers and refs) is accepted. No unintended conversions from other types sneak in.
4. **`noexcept(‚Ä¶)`**

   * Chooses at compile-time whether this constructor is `noexcept`.
   * If `other` is an rvalue ‚Üí checks `is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<Universal>`.
   * Else ‚Üí checks `is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<Universal>`.
   * See [noexcept specifier](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept) for details.
5. **`if constexpr`**

   * Distinguishes **move** vs **copy** branches using `std::is_rvalue_reference_v<U&&>`.

## Delegating Constructors

In C++11 and later, when one constructor invokes another constructor of the *same* class in its member-initializer list, that‚Äôs called **delegating** construction. In our ‚Äúuniversal constructor‚Äù sample we wrote:

```cpp
explicit Universal(U&& other = {}) noexcept(/*‚Ä¶*/)
  : Universal{}         // ‚Üê here: delegate to the default ctor
{
    if constexpr (std::is_rvalue_reference_v<U&&>) {
        data_ = std::move(other.data_);
    } else {
        data_ = other.data_;
    }
}
```

When you write Universal{}, both constructors are viable (one takes 0 args, the other takes 1 with a default). But per the [overload resolution rules](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/overload_resolution#Ranking_of_overload_candidates):

> **Given two viable function overloads, if one is a non-template function and the other is a function template specialization, the non-template is considered more specialized and is chosen.**

So for **direct-list-initialization** (`Universal u{};`):

1. Both `(1)` and `(2)` are viable.
2. The compiler prefers the non-template `Universal()` over the templated one.

We need the default constructor, since it is used to initialize the default argument to the copy/move constructor. Omitting it is an error, since doing so implies the copy/move constructor would have to call itself. So technically we still need two separate constructors and the move/copy constructor will never be called without an argument. But hey, this is all mostly a mental exercise anyway.

---

## Why the default argument rocks (and slightly bites)

Using `U&& other = {}` means:

* **`Universal u;`**
  \--> Calls default constructor.
* **`Universal copy(u);`**
  \--> Deduces `U = Universal&`, copy branch.
* **`Universal move(Universal{});`**
  \--> Deduces `U = Universal`, rvalue branch.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha:** Some compiler bug reports (particularly older MSVC versions before Q3/2023) mis-deduce `U` in certain default-argument cases. Always test in your target toolchains.

## Comparing designs

| Feature             | Traditional ctors       | Universal constructor                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Number of overloads | 3 (default, copy, move) | 1 templated                          |
| Code duplication    | Medium                  | Low                                  |
| `noexcept` control  | Manual per ctor         | Computed via traits + `if constexpr` |
| Readability         | High                    | Moderate                             |
| Potential pitfalls  | Low                     | Template overload complexity         |
| Compiler support    | C++11+                  | C++20+                               |

## Caveats & shortcomings

1. **Interference with special members**
   The templated ctor can suppress the implicit generation of copy/move ctors. If you still want the defaults, you must explicitly `= default;` them.
2. **Overload resolution surprises**
   Other constructors or conversion overloads may be chosen unexpectedly.
3. **Debuggability**
   Stepping through a templated constructor with `if constexpr` can be more confusing than seeing three separate functions.
4. **Concept and `<type_traits>` heavy**
   Requires C++20 concepts (`<concepts>`) or verbose SFINAE.
5. **Portability concerns**

   * GCC 10‚Äì11 had partial concept bugs.
   * MSVC before 19.30 mishandled defaulted template parameters in `noexcept` expressions.
   * Always test on all your platforms!

> **Warning:** In a cross-platform library, introducing one universal constructor may introduce subtle, platform-specific overload ambiguities that are a nightmare to diagnose.

---

## When might you reach for it?

Despite the complexities, I‚Äôve heard of a few niche scenarios where a universal ctor made sense:

* **Small utility types**
  A tiny wrapper like:

  ```cpp
  struct Tag { /* no resources */ };
  ```

  Folding everything into one overload saved a few lines without hurting clarity.
* **Metaprogramming toy libraries**
  When your class is entirely header-only, heavily templated, and you don‚Äôt care about human-readability.
* **Experimentation & teaching**
  As a thought experiment in C++ mastery courses, to show how far you can push the language.

On a large, production-quality codebase? I‚Äôd usually stick with explicit overloads.

---

## Real-world anecdotes

> **Game-dev friend‚Äôs tale**
> A colleague once used a universal ctor in an ECS library. On GCC 10, it compiled fine; on MSVC it silently picked the universal overload for certain custom conversions, leading to a subtle object-slice bug. They reverted to explicit `Foo(const Foo&) = default; Foo(Foo&&) = default;`.
>
> **Finance-sector story**
> A risk-analysis framework folded copy/move into one template. Later, someone tried to add a JSON-load constructor (`Foo(std::string_view json)`), and the template happily accepted that overload, resulting in weird silent failures.

I‚Äôve toyed with it in small, self-contained contexts. Personally, I find the clarity of three separate constructors outweighs the brevity of a single template in most of my code.

---

## Portability & compiler support

| Compiler | Minimum version | Notes                                      |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| GCC      | 10+             | Concepts working, but test `noexcept`.     |
| Clang    | 12+             | Good template support; watch `-std=c++23`. |
| MSVC     | 19.30+          | Fixed default template parameter bugs.     |

If you must support older compilers:

* Fall back to SFINAE with `std::enable_if_t` instead of `requires`.
* Avoid default arguments in the template, and provide an explicit default ctor.

---

## A lighter alternative

If you like brevity but want fewer footguns, consider:

```cpp
struct Simple {
    int data_{};

    Simple() = default;
    Simple(const Simple&) = default;
    Simple(Simple&&) noexcept = default;
};
```

This still gives you three overloads, but each is declared with minimal boilerplate, and the compiler handles all the nuances. I often favor this **Rule of Zero/Three/Five** approach over fancy one-liner templates.

---

## Conclusion

The universal constructor is a neat demonstration of how far C++23‚Äôs templates, `if constexpr`, and concepts can stretch. It can reduce boilerplate in very small utility types or as a teaching tool. But in day-to-day production code, the added template complexity, portability traps, and risk of subtle overload interactions usually outweigh the brevity. I recommend reserving it for toy libraries or code-golf challenges‚Äîand otherwise sticking with explicit default, copy, and move constructors.

Happy coding!
